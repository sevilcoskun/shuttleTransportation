Shuttle Transportation

Build a simplified version of a website for managing online booking of a shared shuttle for people transportation. 
For simplicity, assume there is a single shuttle with a fixed capacity (but the capacity should be configurable in the code 
by means of a define or variable) and do not consider the time of transportation, which is considered fixed as well.
